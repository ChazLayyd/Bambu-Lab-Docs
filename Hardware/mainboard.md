### Mainboard Setup

Before installing the mainboard, there are a few preparation steps to ensure everything fits and works as expected.

#### Sanity Checks

If you have already printed out the **Electronics Box**, you can:

1. Align the mainboard with the electronics box and confirm:
   - (If using a Manta M5P) The pin in the top left aligns with the mounting hole.
   - All three other mounting holes are alligned.
2. If all is aligned, proceed. Otherwise, troubleshoot the fitment or reprint the electronics box. If unsure, reach out on the Community Discord.

#### Manta M5P

1. Install the **BigTreeTech CB1/CB2 (or Raspberry Pi CM4)** onto the **Manta M5P** using 4 **M2.5 x 6mm screws**.
2. Following **BigTreeTech's instructions**, flash your **CB1/CB2** or **Raspberry Pi CM4** with **Klipper** and your preferred Web UI, we can move onto flashing Kalico later.

#### Final Check
- Test that the CB1/2, or Pi CM4 boots, connects to your network and that you have access to your Web UI of choice. If all is good, we can move onto the next step.
