# Printed Parts

### Electronics Box

Before installing the mainboard, there are a few preparation steps to ensure everything fits and works as expected.

#### Sanity Checks
1. Align the mainboard with the electronics box and confirm:
   - (If using a Manta M5P) The pin in the top left aligns with the mounting hole.
   - All three other mounting holes are a perfect fit.
2. If all is aligned, proceed. Otherwise, troubleshoot the fitment or reprint the electronics box.

#### Heat Set Inserts
Melt in **M3 x 5 x 4 heat set inserts** into the electronics box. There are 9 positions to fill (highlighted in the diagram). Use a metal tool with a flat edge to align them neatly.

#### Installing the Mainboard

1. Place the assembled mainboard into the electronics box and secure it with **M3 x 6mm or M3 x 8mm screws**.
2. (Optional) Test the lid fitment by screwing it into place.

#### Final Check
- If everything fits perfectly, remove the lid and the mainboard from the electronics box for wiring and further assembly.

### Fan Cover

Before we continue, make sure to remove any supports on the print.

#### What you will need
1. 4x **4mm x 2mm** Magnets.
2. Some super glue.
3. M3X4.6X3 Heat Set Inserts
4. A 5015 fan **(The stock Bambu Lab 5015 will not work here)**.
5. BIQU Microprobe.

#### Magnets
To match the polarity of the magnets, take your **Original Fan Cover** and note the direction. There are **4 magnets** you will need to insert, these are designed to be a tight fit so please take your time. If your printer is not tuned well, you may have a hard time inserting these. Using the video below, **position the magnets as shown on the rear of the cover**.

>Test the fitment of the fan cover, it attaches exactly the same as the original does. You may notice that the magnets are weaker, but aslong as it alligns you will be fine.

#### Heat Set Inserts
There are **2** heat set inserts that must be inserted on the front of the fan cover, these are used to secure the 5015 fan to the cover. Using a soldering iron, slowly melt them in and use a flat metal object to straighten it out. Once inserted, allign the 5015 fan with the inlet of the duct, and then use two M3X18 ULP screws to secure the 5015 fan to the fan cover.

#### Probe
To install the BIQU Microprobe, first plug in the long provided cable, and then allign the BIQU Microprobe as shown in the video below. Using the screws provided, secure the Microprobe by threading it into the plastic. Make sure the cable is routed the left side of the 5015 fan.

#### Final Check

Once all of the components have been installed, test the fitment again ensuring that you have routed the cables in the correct places. If everything still alligns well, we cna move onto the next step.
