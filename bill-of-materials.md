# Bill of Materials

Below is a list of components used in the project, you are free to use any parts you want in your project. For simplicity, I listed the parts used in the original build.

{: .note}
> Due to recent tarrifs imposed by the US against China, some of these stores may not ship to the US anymore, if you find alternative stores but are worried about their legitimacy contact me on Discord.

{: .warning}
>**Careful, on "Quantity" it is matching the quantities on the links**. E.G, The GDStime 5015 fan link is a 2pcs set, so don't order two of that set as you will get 4 fans.
