# PX1K Documentation

At first, this was a joke. More of a "why not" sort of thing. But as time went on, I really started to think of the benefits of putting Klipper on this machine. All my other printers run on Klipper.. so why not make the Bambu also run on Klipper! It provides a great platform for modding, such as adding extra fans, a nicer webcam, maybe some better controlled neopixel lighting, fully custom toolheads.. And most importantly, having the heatbed capable of running at 110C! Whatever you can think of, you can do it with this platform. It also completely eliminates the Bambu Cloud, allowing you to run everything locally, or even use your own cloud service.. Who else loves privacy?!
